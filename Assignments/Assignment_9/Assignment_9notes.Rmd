## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Put at line #84 in original assignmnet, not sure if I want to keep so safe keeping here.
Determining if an undergraduate's GPA affects their GRE score
```{r, echo=FALSE ,message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
mod2 <- glm(data=df, gre ~ gpa)
moda2 <- aov(data=df, gre ~ gpa)
```

Created two models where GRE score is a function of GPA using a linear model or the one way ANOVA model.
```{r, echo=FALSE ,message=FALSE}
summary(mod2)
summary(moda2)
```

Determined which model was better using their mean residuals squared.
```{r, echo=FALSE ,message=FALSE}
mean(mod2$residuals^2)
mean(moda2$residuals^2)
```
They were the same so the first linear model will be used.

Now predictions based on the linear model will be added to test the model.
```{r, message=FALSE}
df2 <- add_predictions(df,mod2)
# Make a new dataframe with the predictor values to be assessed. 
# mod2 only has "GPA" as a predictor so that's what was added here.
mod2df = data.frame(gpa = c(3.96,3.79,3.26,2.99,2.45))

# making predictions
pred = predict(mod2, newdata = mod2df)

# combining hypothetical input data with hypothetical predictions into one new data frame
hyp_preds <- data.frame(gpa = mod2df$gpa,
                        pred = pred)

# Add new column showing whether a data point is real or hypothetical
df2$PredictionType <- "Real"
hyp_preds$PredictionType <- "Hypothetical"

# joining the real data and hypothetical data (with model predictions)
fullpreds <- full_join(df2,hyp_preds)
```

Plot showing the predictions of the hypothetical GRE scores based upon the hypothetical GPAs of 3.96,3.79,3.26,2.99,2.45 using the linear model
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=10}
ggplot(fullpreds,aes(x=gpa,y=pred,color=PredictionType)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(aes(y=gre),color="Black") +
  theme_minimal()
```

It looks as though GPA does not have a very significant affect on GRE score so it will be taken out of the original model. 

glm(formula = admit ~ gre + gpa + rank + gre:gpa, family = "binomial", 
    data = df)
```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,include=FALSE}
mod3 <- glm(formula = admit ~ gre + gpa + rank, family = "binomial", 
    data = df)
moda3 <- aov(mod3$formula,data = df)
```

A linear model and an ANOVA one way model without GRE as a function of GPA.
```{r, echo=FALSE ,message=FALSE}
summary(mod3)
summary(moda3)
```

Test of the mean residuals to determine which model is best.
```{r, echo=FALSE ,message=FALSE}
mean(mod_step$residuals^2)
mean(mod1$residuals^2)
mean(mod3$residuals^2)
mean(moda3$residuals^2)
```
