# Look through those plots and answer the following questions:
# 1.  Which religious group correlates most strongly in a given area with the proportion of non-religious people?
	LDS
# 2.  What is the direction of that correlation?
	It is a negative or downward correlation. As the proportion of LDS went up the proportion of non-religious people went down and vice-versa.
# 3.  What can you say about the relationships shown here?
	Excluding LDS, there is not much correlation between type of religion and the proportion of religious people. 
# 4.  Examine the axis scales. How could you modify the code above to more accurately portray values on an "equal footing?"
	You could change the scales to "fixed" instead:
		utah %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = "Religion", values_to = "Proportion",religions) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Proportion,y=Religious)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm") + lims(y=c(0,1)) +
  facet_wrap(~Religion,scales = "fixed") + theme_bw() + theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), strip.background = element_rect(fill="Gray"))
