1. Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.
None of my predicted response values seem that meaningless but I think this is because I used light for my predictions 
and you cannot have negative light so they were all positive values which caused the growth rate to be likely positive. 

2. In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? Do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.
Yes, the nitrogen plot looked as if it was a hyperbolic relationship.

3.Write the code you would use to model the data found in “/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv” with a linear model (there are a few ways of doing this)
##load the data in##
dat <- read_csv("../../Data/non_linear_relationship.csv")

##Plot the Data##
ggplot(dat,aes(x=predictor,y=response))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

##Plotting with a linear model##
dat2 <- dat %>%
  filter(predictor >= 1) %>% #99% data is above 1#
  mutate(lpredictor = log2(predictor), lresponse= log2(response)) #log transform the data#

##Take a look##
ggplot(dat2,aes(x=lpredictor,y=lresponse))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

##Make a model of the data##
mod_dat <- lm(lpredictor ~ lresponse, data = dat2)
summary(mod_dat)
