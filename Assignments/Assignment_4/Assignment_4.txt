#Questions:

#1. What other stuff does read.csv() do automatically?
## It will read the csv file in table format and creates a data frame from it, using "," to seperate, and "." for decimals, and the first line as headers. 
#2. How is it different from read.csv2()?
## The difference is that csv2 is a file type that uses ";" to separate and "," to act as decimals.
#3. Why does read.csv2() even exist?
## It exists based on language differences, another language may use a comma as decimal place rather than a period.
#4. How could I change the parameters of read.csv() to make it so the class of the “State” column is “character” instead of “factor?”
## You can change it to a character using the following command:
State_character <- as.character(df$State)
#5. What command would give the summary stats for ONLY the Home.Value column?
## df[,"Home.Value"]
#6. What value is returned by the command: names(df)[4] ?
## Home.Value
#7. What is happening when you add (…col=df$region) to the above plotting code?
#In other words, what happens when you run: plot(x=df$Year,y=df$Land.Value,col=df$region)
##It will color the points by region.
